      Mathematics is the study of patterns! From the beginning of time, humans
      have been looking for patterns all around them! Wait, is it just humans?
      (Do your research to know more!) If a pattern in nature can be
      mathematically modeled and if the model is consistent everywhere in the
      universe, your model becomes a law! Famous Indian mathematician Srinivasa
      Ramanujana worked on infinite series, continued fractions, number theory
      etc. &sum;k = n(n+1)/2 summation K upto n &sum;k^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
      summation k^2 upto n
