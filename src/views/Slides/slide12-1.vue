                A digital counter works on the basis of incrementing a binary number of n digits(called bit length).
                <strong>For instance</strong>: a 2-bit or 3-bit counter (depending on the bit length).A counter counts the transition from low to high or 0 to 1 and not 1 to 0
            </p>
            <p>
                An n bit counter can count up to 2n (i.e 0 â€“ (2n-1)) and then starts again from 0 at the next count.
            </p>
            <p><strong>A 3-bit counter counts as shown</strong>
