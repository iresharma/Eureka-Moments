          Suppose there is some finite number of clubs in University, We have a
          list of clubs and students enrolled in each club. Many clubs have
          common students. We plan to schedule the event so that no two clubs
          with a common student are scheduled at the same time and To satisfy
          this, How many minimum time slots are required?
